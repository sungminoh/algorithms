### [71. Simplify Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/simplify-path/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-04-12)

Medium

Given a string `` path ``, which is an __absolute path__ (starting with a slash `` '/' ``) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified __canonical path__.

In a Unix-style file system, a period `` '.' `` refers to the current directory, a double period `` '..' `` refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. `` '//' ``) are treated as a single slash `` '/' ``. For this problem, any other format of periods such as `` '...' `` are treated as file/directory names.

The __canonical path__ should have the following format:

*   The path starts with a single slash `` '/' ``.
*   Any two directories are separated by a single slash `` '/' ``.
*   The path does not end with a trailing `` '/' ``.
*   The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `` '.' `` or double period `` '..' ``)

Return _the simplified __canonical path___.

 

<strong class="example">Example 1:</strong>

```
Input: path = "/home/"
Output: "/home"
Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.
```

<strong class="example">Example 2:</strong>

```
Input: path = "/../"
Output: "/"
Explanation: Going one level up from the root directory is a no-op, as the root level is the highest level you can go.
```

<strong class="example">Example 3:</strong>

```
Input: path = "/home//foo/"
Output: "/home/foo"
Explanation: In the canonical path, multiple consecutive slashes are replaced by a single one.
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   `` 1 <= path.length <= 3000 ``
*   `` path `` consists of English letters, digits, period `` '.' ``, slash `` '/' `` or `` '_' ``.
*   `` path `` is a valid absolute Unix path.
