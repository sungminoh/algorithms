### [476. Number Complement](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/#)

Easy

The __complement__ of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the `` 0 ``'s to `` 1 ``'s and all the `` 1 ``'s to `` 0 ``'s in its binary representation.

*   For example, The integer `` 5 `` is `` "101" `` in binary and its __complement__ is `` "010" `` which is the integer `` 2 ``.

Given an integer `` num ``, return _its complement_.

 

__Example 1:__

```
Input: num = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: num = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   <code>1 <= num < 2<sup>31</sup></code>
