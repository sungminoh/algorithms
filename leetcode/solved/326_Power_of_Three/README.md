### [326. Power of Three](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/)

Easy

Given an integer `` n ``, return _`` true `` if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return `` false ``_.

An integer `` n `` is a power of three, if there exists an integer `` x `` such that <code>n == 3<sup>x</sup></code>.

 

__Example 1:__

```
Input: n = 27
Output: true
Explanation: 27 = 3<sup>3</sup>
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: n = 0
Output: false
Explanation: There is no x where 3<sup>x</sup> = 0.
```

__Example 3:__

```
Input: n = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no x where 3<sup>x</sup> = (-1).
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   <code>-2<sup>31</sup> <= n <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>

 
__Follow up:__ Could you solve it without loops/recursion?
