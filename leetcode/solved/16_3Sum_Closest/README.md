### [16. 3Sum Closest](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/)

Medium

Given an integer array `` nums `` of length `` n `` and an integer `` target ``, find three integers in `` nums `` such that the sum is closest to `` target ``.

Return _the sum of the three integers_.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

 

__Example 1:__

```
Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
Output: 0
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   `` 3 <= nums.length <= 1000 ``
*   `` -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000 ``
*   <code>-10<sup>4</sup> <= target <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
