Medium

Given string `` S `` and a dictionary of words `` words ``, find the number of `` words[i] `` that is a subsequence of `` S ``.

<strong>Example :</strong>
<strong>Input:</strong> 
    S = "abcde"
    words = ["a", "bb", "acd", "ace"]
    <strong>Output:</strong> 3

*   The length of `` S `` will be in the range of `` [1, 50000] ``.
*   The length of `` words `` will be in the range of `` [1, 5000] ``.
