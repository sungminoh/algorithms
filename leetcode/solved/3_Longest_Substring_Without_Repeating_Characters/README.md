------

Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

**Examples:**

Given `"abcabcbb"`, the answer is `"abc"`, which the length is 3.

Given `"bbbbb"`, the answer is `"b"`, with the length of 1.

Given `"pwwkew"`, the answer is `"wke"`, with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a **substring**, `"pwke"` is a *subsequence*and not a substring.
