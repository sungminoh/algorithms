"""
Given an array of strings strs, return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between them. If the longest uncommon subsequence does not exist, return -1.

An uncommon subsequence between an array of strings is a string that is a subsequence of one string but not the others.

A subsequence of a string s is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from s.

	For example, "abc" is a subsequence of "aebdc" because you can delete the underlined characters in "aebdc" to get "abc". Other subsequences of "aebdc" include "aebdc", "aeb", and "" (empty string).

Example 1:
Input: strs = ["aba","cdc","eae"]
Output: 3
Example 2:
Input: strs = ["aaa","aaa","aa"]
Output: -1

Constraints:

	2 <= strs.length <= 50
	1 <= strs[i].length <= 10
	strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
