"""
Given an array, strs, with strings consisting of only 0s and 1s. Also two integers m and n.

Now your task is to find the maximum number of strings that you can form with given m 0s and n 1s. Each 0 and 1 can be used at most once.

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["10","0001","111001","1","0"], m = 5, n = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: This are totally 4 strings can be formed by the using of 5 0s and 3 1s, which are "10","0001","1","0".

Example 2:

Input: strs = ["10","0","1"], m = 1, n = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: You could form "10", but then you'd have nothing left. Better form "0" and "1".

Constraints:
* 1 <= strs.length <= 600
* 1 <= strs[i].length <= 100
* strs[i] consists only of digits '0' and '1'.
* 1 <= m, n <= 100
