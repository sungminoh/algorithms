### [205. Isomorphic Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/)

Easy

Given two strings `` s `` and `` t ``, _determine if they are isomorphic_.

Two strings `` s `` and `` t `` are isomorphic if the characters in `` s `` can be replaced to get `` t ``.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

 

__Example 1:__

```Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```

__Example 2:__

```Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```

__Example 3:__

```Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   <code>1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
*   `` t.length == s.length ``
*   `` s `` and `` t `` consist of any valid ascii character.
