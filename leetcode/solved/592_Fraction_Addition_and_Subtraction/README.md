### [592. Fraction Addition and Subtraction](https://leetcode.com/problems/fraction-addition-and-subtraction/)

Medium

Given a string representing an expression of fraction addition and subtraction, you need to return the calculation result in string format. The final result should be [irreducible fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_fraction). If your final result is an integer, say `` 2 ``, you need to change it to the format of fraction that has denominator `` 1 ``. So in this case, `` 2 `` should be converted to `` 2/1 ``.

__Example 1:__  

```
<b>Input:</b>"-1/2+1/2"
<b>Output:</b> "0/1"
```

__Example 2:__  

```
<b>Input:</b>"-1/2+1/2+1/3"
<b>Output:</b> "1/3"
```

__Example 3:__  

```
<b>Input:</b>"1/3-1/2"
<b>Output:</b> "-1/6"
```

__Example 4:__  

```
<b>Input:</b>"5/3+1/3"
<b>Output:</b> "2/1"
```

__Note:__  

1.   The input string only contains `` '0' `` to `` '9' ``, `` '/' ``, `` '+' `` and `` '-' ``. So does the output.
2.   Each fraction (input and output) has format `` Â±numerator/denominator ``. If the first input fraction or the output is positive, then `` '+' `` will be omitted.
3.   The input only contains valid __irreducible fractions__, where the __numerator__ and __denominator__ of each fraction will always be in the range \[1,10\]. If the denominator is 1, it means this fraction is actually an integer in a fraction format defined above.
4.   The number of given fractions will be in the range \[1,10\].
5.   The numerator and denominator of the __final result__ are guaranteed to be valid and in the range of 32-bit int.
