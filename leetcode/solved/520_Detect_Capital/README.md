Easy

We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:

*   All letters in this word are capitals, like `` "USA" ``.
*   All letters in this word are not capitals, like `` "leetcode" ``.
*   Only the first letter in this word is capital, like `` "Google" ``.

Given a string `` word ``, return `` true `` if the usage of capitals in it is right.

```

<strong class="example">Example 2:</strong>

```Input: word = "FlaG"
Output: false
```
