<strong class="example">Example 1:</strong>

Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```

<strong class="example">Example 2:</strong>

```Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
```

<strong class="example">Example 3:</strong>

```Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   <code>1 <= strs.length <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
*   `` 0 <= strs[i].length <= 100 ``
*   `` strs[i] `` consists of lowercase English letters.
