### [42. Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

Hard

Given `` n `` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `` 1 ``, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

 

<strong class="example">Example 1:</strong>

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/rainwatertrap.png" style="width: 412px; height: 161px;"/>

```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
```

<strong class="example">Example 2:</strong>

```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   `` n == height.length ``
*   <code>1 <= n <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
*   <code>0 <= height[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
