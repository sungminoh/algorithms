[**Pick One](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-one-question/)

------

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 123
Output:  321

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: -123
Output: -321

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: 120
Output: 21

```

**Note:**
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only hold integers within the 32-bit signed integer range. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
