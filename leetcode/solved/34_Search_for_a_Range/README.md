------

Given an array of integers sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of *O*(log *n*).

If the target is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

For example,
Given `[5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]` and target value 8,
return `[3, 4]`.
