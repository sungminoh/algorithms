### [287. Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)

Medium

Given an array of integers `` nums `` containing `` n + 1 `` integers where each integer is in the range `` [1, n] `` inclusive.

There is only __one repeated number__ in `` nums ``, return _this repeated number_.

You must solve the problem __without__ modifying the array `` nums `` and uses only constant extra space.

 

__Example 1:__

```
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   <code>1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   `` nums.length == n + 1 ``
*   `` 1 <= nums[i] <= n ``
*   All the integers in `` nums `` appear only __once__ except for __precisely one integer__ which appears __two or more__ times.

 

__Follow up:__

*   How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in `` nums ``?
*   Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?
