Medium

Given an integer `` n ``, return _the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to_ `` n ``.

A __perfect square__ is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, `` 1 ``, `` 4 ``, `` 9 ``, and `` 16 `` are perfect squares while `` 3 `` and `` 11 `` are not.

 

__Example 1:__

```
Input: n = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: n = 13
Output: 2
