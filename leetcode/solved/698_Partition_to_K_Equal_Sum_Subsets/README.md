### [698. Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-to-k-equal-sum-subsets/)

Medium

Given an array of integers `` nums `` and a positive integer `` k ``, find whether it's possible to divide this array into `` k `` non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.

 

__Example 1:__

```
<b>Input:</b> nums = [4, 3, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1], k = 4
<b>Output:</b> True
<b>Explanation:</b> It's possible to divide it into 4 subsets (5), (1, 4), (2,3), (2,3) with equal sums.
```

 

__Note:__

*   `` 1 <= k <= len(nums) <= 16 ``.
*   `` 0 < nums[i] < 10000 ``.
