### [88. Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)

Easy

You are given two integer arrays `` nums1 `` and `` nums2 ``, sorted in __non-decreasing order__, and two integers `` m `` and `` n ``, representing the number of elements in `` nums1 `` and `` nums2 `` respectively.

__Merge__ `` nums1 `` and `` nums2 `` into a single array sorted in __non-decreasing order__.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be _stored inside the array _`` nums1 ``. To accommodate this, `` nums1 `` has a length of `` m + n ``, where the first `` m `` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `` n `` elements are set to `` 0 `` and should be ignored. `` nums2 `` has a length of `` n ``.

 

__Example 1:__

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [<u>1</u>,<u>2</u>,2,<u>3</u>,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].
```

__Example 3:__

```
Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   `` nums1.length == m + n ``
*   `` nums2.length == n ``
*   `` 0 <= m, n <= 200 ``
*   `` 1 <= m + n <= 200 ``
*   <code>-10<sup>9</sup> <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>

 

__Follow up: __Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `` O(m + n) `` time?
