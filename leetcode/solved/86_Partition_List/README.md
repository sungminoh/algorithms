------

Given a linked list and a value *x*, partition it such that all nodes less than *x* come before nodes greater than or equal to *x*.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

**Example:**

```
Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5
```
