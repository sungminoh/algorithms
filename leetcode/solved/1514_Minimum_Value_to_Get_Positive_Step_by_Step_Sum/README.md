### [1514. Minimum Value to Get Positive Step by Step Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-value-to-get-positive-step-by-step-sum/)

Easy

Given an array of integers `` nums ``, you start with an initial __positive__ value _startValue__._

In each iteration, you calculate the step by step sum of _startValue_ plus elements in `` nums `` (from left to right).

Return the minimum __positive__ value of _startValue_ such that the step by step sum is never less than 1.

 

__Example 1:__

```
Input: nums = [-3,2,-3,4,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: If you choose startValue = 4, in the third iteration your step by step sum is less than 1.
step by step sum
startValue = 4 | startValue = 5 | nums
  (4 -3 ) = 1  | (5 -3 ) = 2    |  -3
  (1 +2 ) = 3  | (2 +2 ) = 4    |   2
  (3 -3 ) = 0  | (4 -3 ) = 1    |  -3
  (0 +4 ) = 4  | (1 +4 ) = 5    |   4
  (4 +2 ) = 6  | (5 +2 ) = 7    |   2
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: Minimum start value should be positive. 
```

__Example 3:__

```
Input: nums = [1,-2,-3]
Output: 5
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   `` 1 <= nums.length <= 100 ``
*   `` -100 <= nums[i] <= 100 ``
