### [406. Queue Reconstruction by Height](https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/)

Medium

You are given an array of people, `` people ``, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each <code>people[i] = [h<sub>i</sub>, k<sub>i</sub>]</code> represents the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> person of height <code>h<sub>i</sub></code> with __exactly__ <code>k<sub>i</sub></code> other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to <code>h<sub>i</sub></code>.

Reconstruct and return _the queue that is represented by the input array _`` people ``. The returned queue should be formatted as an array `` queue ``, where <code>queue[j] = [h<sub>j</sub>, k<sub>j</sub>]</code> is the attributes of the <code>j<sup>th</sup></code> person in the queue (`` queue[0] `` is the person at the front of the queue).

 

__Example 1:__

```
Input: people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]
Output: [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]
Explanation:
Person 0 has height 5 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 1 has height 7 with no other people taller or the same height in front.
Person 2 has height 5 with two persons taller or the same height in front, which is person 0 and 1.
Person 3 has height 6 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Person 4 has height 4 with four people taller or the same height in front, which are people 0, 1, 2, and 3.
Person 5 has height 7 with one person taller or the same height in front, which is person 1.
Hence [[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]] is the reconstructed queue.
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: people = [[6,0],[5,0],[4,0],[3,2],[2,2],[1,4]]
Output: [[4,0],[5,0],[2,2],[3,2],[1,4],[6,0]]
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   `` 1 <= people.length <= 2000 ``
*   <code>0 <= h<sub>i</sub> <= 10<sup>6</sup></code>
*   <code>0 <= k<sub>i</sub> < people.length</code>
*   It is guaranteed that the queue can be reconstructed.
