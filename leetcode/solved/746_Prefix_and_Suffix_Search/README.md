### [746. Prefix and Suffix Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/prefix-and-suffix-search/)

Hard

Design a special dictionary with some words that searchs the words in it by a prefix and a suffix.

Implement the `` WordFilter `` class:

*   `` WordFilter(string[] words) `` Initializes the object with the `` words `` in the dictionary.
*   `` f(string prefix, string suffix) `` Returns _the index of the word in the dictionary,_ which has the prefix `` prefix `` and the suffix `` suffix ``. If there is more than one valid index, return __the largest__ of them. If there is no such word in the dictionary, return `` -1 ``.

 

__Example 1:__

```
Input
["WordFilter", "f"]
[[["apple"]], ["a", "e"]]
Output
[null, 0]

Explanation
WordFilter wordFilter = new WordFilter(["apple"]);
wordFilter.f("a", "e"); // return 0, because the word at index 0 has prefix = "a" and suffix = 'e".
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   `` 1 <= words.length <= 15000 ``
*   `` 1 <= words[i].length <= 10 ``
*   `` 1 <= prefix.length, suffix.length <= 10 ``
*   `` words[i] ``, `` prefix `` and `` suffix `` consist of lower-case English letters only.
*   At most `` 15000 `` calls will be made to the function `` f ``.
