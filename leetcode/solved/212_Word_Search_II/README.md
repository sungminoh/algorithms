### [212. Word Search II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search-ii/)

Hard

Given an `` m x n `` `` board `` of characters and a list of strings `` words ``, return _all words on the board_.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where __adjacent cells__ are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

 

__Example 1:__

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/07/search1.jpg" style="width: 322px; height: 322px;"/>

```
Input: board = [["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]], words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
Output: ["eat","oath"]
```

__Example 2:__

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/07/search2.jpg" style="width: 162px; height: 162px;"/>

```
Input: board = [["a","b"],["c","d"]], words = ["abcb"]
Output: []
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   `` m == board.length ``
*   `` n == board[i].length ``
*   `` 1 <= m, n <= 12 ``
*   `` board[i][j] `` is a lowercase English letter.
*   <code>1 <= words.length <= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
*   `` 1 <= words[i].length <= 10 ``
*   `` words[i] `` consists of lowercase English letters.
*   All the strings of `` words `` are unique.
