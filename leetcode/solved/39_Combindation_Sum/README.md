------

Given a **set** of candidate numbers (**C**) **(without duplicates)** and a target number (**T**), find all unique combinations in **C** where the candidate numbers sums to **T**.

The **same** repeated number may be chosen from **C** unlimited number of times.

**Note:**

- All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
- The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

For example, given candidate set `[2, 3, 6, 7]` and target `7`, 
A solution set is: 

```
[
  [7],
  [2, 2, 3]
]

```
