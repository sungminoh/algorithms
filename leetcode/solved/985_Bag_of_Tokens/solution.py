"""
You have an initial power P, an initial score of 0 points, and a bag of tokens.

Each token can be used at most once, has a value token[i], and has potentially two ways to use it.

	If we have at least token[i] power, we may play the token face up, losing token[i] power, and gaining 1 point.
	If we have at least 1 point, we may play the token face down, gaining token[i] power, and losing 1 point.

Return the largest number of points we can have after playing any number of tokens.

Example 1:

Input: tokens = [100], P = 50
Output: 0

Example 2:

Input: tokens = [100,200], P = 150
Output: 1

Example 3:

Input: tokens = [100,200,300,400], P = 200
Output: 2

Note:

	tokens.length
	0
