### [900. Reordered Power of 2](https://leetcode.com/problems/reordered-power-of-2/)

Medium

You are given an integer `` n ``. We reorder the digits in any order (including the original order) such that the leading digit is not zero.

Return `` true `` _if and only if we can do this so that the resulting number is a power of two_.

 

__Example 1:__

```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: n = 10
Output: false
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   <code>1 <= n <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
