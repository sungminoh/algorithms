### [128. Longest Consecutive Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/)

Medium

Given an unsorted array of integers `` nums ``, return _the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence._

You must write an algorithm that runs in `` O(n) `` time.

 

__Example 1:__

<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
    <strong>Output:</strong> 4
    <strong>Explanation:</strong> The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

__Example 2:__

```
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   <code>0 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
*   <code>-10<sup>9</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>
