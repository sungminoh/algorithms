"""
Given an n x n binary matrix grid, return the length of the shortest clear path in the matrix. If there is no clear path, return -1.

A clear path in a binary matrix is a path from the top-left cell (i.e., (0, 0)) to the bottom-right cell (i.e., (n - 1, n - 1)) such that:

	All the visited cells of the path are 0.
	All the adjacent cells of the path are 8-directionally connected (i.e., they are different and they share an edge or a corner).

The length of a clear path is the number of visited cells of this path.

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: grid = [[0,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
Output: 4

Example 3:

Input: grid = [[1,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
Output: -1

Constraints:

	n == grid.length
	n == grid[i].length
	1 <= n <= 100
	grid[i][j] is 0 or 1
