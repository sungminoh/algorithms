"""
Your are given an array of integers prices, for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i; and a non-negative integer fee representing a transaction fee.
You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.  You may not buy more than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.)
Return the maximum profit you can make.

Example 1:

Input: prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
Buying at prices[0] = 1Selling at prices[3] = 8Buying at prices[4] = 4Selling at prices[5] = 9The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.

Note:
0 < prices.length <= 50000.
0 < prices[i] < 50000.
0 <= fee < 50000.
