### [101. Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)

Easy

Given the `` root `` of a binary tree, _check whether it is a mirror of itself_ (i.e., symmetric around its center).

 

<strong class="example">Example 1:</strong>

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/symtree1.jpg" style="width: 354px; height: 291px;"/>

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
```

<strong class="example">Example 2:</strong>

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/symtree2.jpg" style="width: 308px; height: 258px;"/>

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `` [1, 1000] ``.
*   `` -100 <= Node.val <= 100 ``

 
__Follow up:__ Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?
