------

Given a collection of candidate numbers (**C**) and a target number (**T**), find all unique combinations in **C** where the candidate numbers sums to **T**.

Each number in **C** may only be used **once** in the combination.

**Note:**

- All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
- The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

For example, given candidate set `[10, 1, 2, 7, 6, 1, 5]` and target `8`, 
A solution set is: 

```
[
  [1, 7],
  [1, 2, 5],
  [2, 6],
  [1, 1, 6]
]
```
