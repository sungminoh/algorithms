### [43. Multiply Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/multiply-strings/)

Medium

Given two non-negative integers `` num1 `` and `` num2 `` represented as strings, return the product of `` num1 `` and `` num2 ``, also represented as a string.

__Note:__ You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

 

__Example 1:__

```Input: num1 = "2", num2 = "3"
Output: "6"
```

__Example 2:__

```Input: num1 = "123", num2 = "456"
Output: "56088"
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   `` 1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 200 ``
*   `` num1 `` and `` num2 `` consist of digits only.
*   Both `` num1 `` and `` num2 `` do not contain any leading zero, except the number `` 0 `` itself.
