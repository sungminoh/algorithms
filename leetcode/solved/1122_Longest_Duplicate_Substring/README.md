### [1122. Longest Duplicate Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-duplicate-substring/)

Hard

Given a string `` s ``, consider all _duplicated substrings_: (contiguous) substrings of s that occur 2 or more times. The occurrences may overlap.

Return __any__ duplicated substring that has the longest possible length. If `` s `` does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is `` "" ``.

 

__Example 1:__

```Input: s = "banana"
Output: "ana"
```

__Example 2:__

```Input: s = "abcd"
Output: ""
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   <code>2 <= s.length <= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
*   `` s `` consists of lowercase English letters.
