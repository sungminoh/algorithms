### [1554. Minimum Time to Collect All Apples in a Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-collect-all-apples-in-a-tree/)

Medium

Given an undirected tree consisting of `` n `` vertices numbered from `` 0 `` to `` n-1 ``, which has some apples in their vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over one edge of the tree. _Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend to collect all apples in the tree, starting at __vertex 0__ and coming back to this vertex._

The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array `` edges ``, where <code>edges[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> means that exists an edge connecting the vertices <code>a<sub>i</sub></code> and <code>b<sub>i</sub></code>. Additionally, there is a boolean array `` hasApple ``, where `` hasApple[i] = true `` means that vertex `` i `` has an apple; otherwise, it does not have any apple.

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/23/min_time_collect_apple_1.png" style="width: 300px; height: 212px;"/>

```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,true,false,true,true,false]
Output: 8 
Explanation: The figure above represents the given tree where red vertices have an apple. One optimal path to collect all apples is shown by the green arrows.  
```

```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,true,false,false,true,false]
Output: 6

<strong class="example">Example 3:</strong>

```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], hasApple = [false,false,false,false,false,false,false]
Output: 0
