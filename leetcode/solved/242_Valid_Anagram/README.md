### [242. Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/)

Easy

Given two strings `` s `` and `` t ``, return `` true `` _if_ `` t `` _is an anagram of_ `` s ``_, and_ `` false `` _otherwise_.

An __Anagram__ is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

__Example 1:__

```Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

__Example 2:__

```Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   <code>1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
*   `` s `` and `` t `` consist of lowercase English letters.

 

__Follow up:__ What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?
