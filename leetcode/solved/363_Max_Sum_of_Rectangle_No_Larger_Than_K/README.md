### [363. Max Sum of Rectangle No Larger Than K](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-sum-of-rectangle-no-larger-than-k/)

Hard

Given a non-empty 2D matrix _matrix_ and an integer _k_, find the max sum of a rectangle in the _matrix_ such that its sum is no larger than _k_.

__Example:__

<strong>Input: </strong>matrix = <span id="example-input-1-1">[[1,0,1],[0,-2,3]]</span>, k = <span id="example-input-1-2">2</span>
<strong>Output: </strong><span id="example-output-1">2 
    <strong>Explanation:</strong></span> Because the sum of rectangle [[0, 1], [-2, 3]] is 2,
                 and 2 is the max number no larger than k (k = 2).

__Note:__

1.   The rectangle inside the matrix must have an area > 0.
2.   What if the number of rows is much larger than the number of columns?
