------

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an *m* x *n* matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
matrix = [
  [1,   3,  5,  7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 50]
]
target = 3
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
matrix = [
  [1,   3,  5,  7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 50]
]
target = 13
Output: false
```
