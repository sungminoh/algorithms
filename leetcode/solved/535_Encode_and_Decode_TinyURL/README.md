>  Note: This is a companion problem to the <a href="https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/system-design/" target="_blank">System Design</a> problem: <a href="https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/124658/Design-a-URL-Shortener-(-TinyURL-)-System/" target="_blank">Design TinyURL</a>.

TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as `` https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl `` and it returns a short URL such as `` http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk ``.

Design the `` encode `` and `` decode `` methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.
