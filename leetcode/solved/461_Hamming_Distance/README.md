### [461. Hamming Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/#)

Easy

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance" target="_blank">Hamming distance</a> between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `` x `` and `` y ``, return _the __Hamming distance__ between them_.

 

__Example 1:__

```
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑
The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: x = 3, y = 1
Output: 1
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   <code>0 <= x, y <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>
