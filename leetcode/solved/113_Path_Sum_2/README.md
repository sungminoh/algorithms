------

Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given the below binary tree and `sum = 22`,

```
      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \    / \

[
   [5,4,11,2],
   [5,8,4,5]
]
