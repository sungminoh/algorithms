### [92. Reverse Linked List II](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/)

Medium

Given the `` head `` of a singly linked list and two integers `` left `` and `` right `` where `` left <= right ``, reverse the nodes of the list from position `` left `` to position `` right ``, and return _the reversed list_.

 

__Example 1:__

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev2ex2.jpg" style="width: 542px; height: 222px;"/>

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
Output: [5]
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   The number of nodes in the list is `` n ``.
*   `` 1 <= n <= 500 ``
*   `` -500 <= Node.val <= 500 ``
*   `` 1 <= left <= right <= n ``
