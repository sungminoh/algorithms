### [415. Add Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-strings)

Easy

Given two non-negative integers, `` num1 `` and `` num2 `` represented as string, return _the sum of_ `` num1 `` _and_ `` num2 `` _as a string_.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as `` BigInteger ``). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.

 

__Example 1:__

```
Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"
Output: "134"
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: num1 = "456", num2 = "77"
Output: "533"
```

__Example 3:__

```
Input: num1 = "0", num2 = "0"
Output: "0"
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   <code>1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
*   `` num1 `` and `` num2 `` consist of only digits.
*   `` num1 `` and `` num2 `` don't have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.
