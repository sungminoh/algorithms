### [62. Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)

Medium

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a `` m x n `` grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

 

__Example 1:__

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/robot_maze.png" style="width: 400px; height: 183px;"/>

```
Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
```

__Example 3:__

```
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
```

__Example 4:__

```
Input: m = 3, n = 3
Output: 6
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   `` 1 <= m, n <= 100 ``
*   It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to <code>2 * 10<sup>9</sup></code>.
