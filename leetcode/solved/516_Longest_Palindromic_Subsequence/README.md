### [516. Longest Palindromic Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-04-14)

Medium

Given a string `` s ``, find _the longest palindromic __subsequence__'s length in_ `` s ``.

A __subsequence__ is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

<strong class="example">Example 1:</strong>

```
Input: s = "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
```

<strong class="example">Example 2:</strong>

```
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   `` 1 <= s.length <= 1000 ``
*   `` s `` consists only of lowercase English letters.
