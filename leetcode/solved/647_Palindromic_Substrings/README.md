### [647. Palindromic Substrings](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/)

Medium

Given a string `` s ``, return _the number of __palindromic substrings__ in it_.

A string is a __palindrome__ when it reads the same backward as forward.

A __substring__ is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

 

__Example 1:__

```
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   `` 1 <= s.length <= 1000 ``
*   `` s `` consists of lowercase English letters.
