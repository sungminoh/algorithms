### [258. Add Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-digits/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-04-26)

Easy

Given an integer `` num ``, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

 

<strong class="example">Example 1:</strong>

```
Input: num = 38
Output: 2
Explanation: The process is
38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2 
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
```

<strong class="example">Example 2:</strong>

```
Input: num = 0
Output: 0
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   <code>0 <= num <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code>

 

__Follow up:__ Could you do it without any loop/recursion in `` O(1) `` runtime?
