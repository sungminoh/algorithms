------

Given an array *S* of *n* integers, are there elements *a*, *b*, *c* in *S* such that *a* + *b* + *c* = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

**Note:** The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

```
For example, given array S = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
