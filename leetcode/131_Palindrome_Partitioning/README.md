### [131. Palindrome Partitioning](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/)

Medium

Given a string `` s ``, partition `` s `` such that every substring of the partition is a __palindrome__. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of `` s ``.

A __palindrome__ string is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

 

__Example 1:__

```Input: s = "aab"
Output: [["a","a","b"],["aa","b"]]
```

__Example 2:__

```Input: s = "a"
Output: [["a"]]
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   `` 1 <= s.length <= 16 ``
*   `` s `` contains only lowercase English letters.
