### [1454. Remove Palindromic Subsequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-palindromic-subsequences/)

Easy

You are given a string `` s `` consisting __only__ of letters `` 'a' `` and `` 'b' ``. In a single step you can remove one __palindromic subsequence__ from `` s ``.

Return _the __minimum__ number of steps to make the given string empty_.

A string is a __subsequence__ of a given string if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order. Note that a subsequence does __not__ necessarily need to be contiguous.

A string is called __palindrome__ if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

 

__Example 1:__

```
Input: s = "ababa"
Output: 1
Explanation: s is already a palindrome, so its entirety can be removed in a single step.
```

__Example 2:__

```
Input: s = "abb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "<u>a</u>bb" -> "<u>bb</u>" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".
```

__Example 3:__

```
Input: s = "baabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "<u>baa</u>b<u>b</u>" -> "<u>b</u>" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   `` 1 <= s.length <= 1000 ``
*   `` s[i] `` is either `` 'a' `` or `` 'b' ``.
