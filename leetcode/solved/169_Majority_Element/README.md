### [169. Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)

Easy

Given an array `` nums `` of size `` n ``, return _the majority element_.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `` ⌊n / 2⌋ `` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

 

__Example 1:__

```Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

__Example 2:__

```Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```

 

__Constraints:__

*   `` n == nums.length ``
*   <code>1 <= n <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
*   <code>-10<sup>9</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup></code>

 
__Follow-up:__ Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `` O(1) `` space?
